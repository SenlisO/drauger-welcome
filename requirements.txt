In order to do development on drauger-welcome, there are a few packages you need installed:

python3
gir1.2-gtk-3.0

It is also strongly recommended you run and develop this in Linux, preferably a Debian-based environment.
Furthermore, in testing, unless you are on Drauger OS, comment out lines 33 and 34 of usr/share/drauger-welcome/welcome.py and 
manually set the variable 's'. Otherwise, it will throw an error.
